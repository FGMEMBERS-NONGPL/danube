History of mesh.

Well this is an old one!  This was my first "proper" mesh before this I hab built a small vorcha class cruiser based on a micromachine I had.   For this one I biught my first trek model kit and spent 2 months taking to pieces the kit and measure it.  I built this mesh in 3d studio R3 and R4,  I got hold of R4 about halway through building it.   I used string and a ruler at this point no screen grabs were easily available for it.  This mesh features heavily in some of my first renderings as its one of the only ones I had.

There are lots of mistakes on the mesh and its not a good example of building a acurate mesh.  The front bit
is lofted and so is tha main hull,  but 99% of the rest of the detail is just bolted on boxes!  And I havn't improved at building in the last 5 years either.

I have setup some simple lighting and glows for a video post render and redone the materials (no mapps!)

The original mapp I used to texture this mesh came with R4 so I can't distribute it.

This mesh has been seen on the web before but always creditted to the wrong author.

Well now you know hwo actaully made it!

Commentary by Stewart:

I downloaded this mesh in 2005 with the intention of flying it in
FightGear, instead of the ufo saucer. 

The crude nature of this mesh, that Matt wrote about, seemed to overload
the rendering engine. Too many vertices and too many faces that did not
connect properly.

It wasn't until late 2006 that I found the time and knowledge of how to
clean up the mesh. I made a series of breakthroughs, in understanding the
problem, and in learning the resources of Blender.

I reduced the polygon count from 56009 to 18921 in my first series, before 
figuring out that wasn't the only problem. So I went back to the original, 
and cleaned it up without removing detail.

After removing holes in the mesh, and faces that could not be seen from
the outside, then adding animation appropriate to FlightGear, the polygon
count is now lower. Still a huge model, but functional.

The LCARS panels I added to the cockpit were obtained from 
 http://www.utopiaplanitia.info/blueprints
and are admittedly not the correct helm panels for the runabout, 
but they look close enough.
